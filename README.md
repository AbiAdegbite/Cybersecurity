# Welcome To Abi A's Cybersecurity Portfolio

Here I have accumulated a few projects that showcase my skills and passion for safeguarding digital assets. 

## Featured Projects

**1.HackThisSite.org Penetration Test Report**

A series of penetration tests were conducted by myself on Basic Levels 1-11 on HackThisSite.org. The details from the test were compiled into a Penetration Testing Report which includes an executive summary, scope of web application tested, vulnerability descriptions and key findings for each level as well as recommendations to better secure the web application.
